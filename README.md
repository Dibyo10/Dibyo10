## 👋 About Me

I’m Dibyo, a Computer Science undergrad focused on **how systems actually behave** — under load, over time, and when things fail.

I gravitate toward problems where:
- trade-offs are unavoidable
- correctness matters more than speed
- systems must remain debuggable months later

My work spans **backend systems**, **machine learning (classical + modern)**, and **LLM infrastructure**, with a strong emphasis on reasoning from fundamentals rather than copying patterns.

## 🧠 Core Focus Areas

### Backend & Systems
- Concurrency-safe services using goroutines, mutexes, worker pools
- Time-based algorithms with lazy evaluation and strict invariants
- REST APIs with validation, authentication, middleware, and clean routing
- Rate limiting systems (Token Bucket, Leaky Bucket, Sliding Window)
- Failure analysis and load behavior reasoning

### Machine Learning (Classical + Foundations)
- Linear algebra: PCA, eigenvectors, SVD, Rayleigh quotient
- Optimization: GD, SGD, Momentum, Adam
- Probabilistic models: GMMs, Bayesian scoring
- Recommender systems:
  - content-based filtering
  - collaborative filtering
  - matrix factorization
  - time-decay & momentum-based ranking
- Dimensionality reduction: PCA, t-SNE, UMAP (theory + trade-offs)

### Deep Learning & Sequence Models
- Vanilla RNNs and Backpropagation Through Time (from scratch)
- Understanding vanishing/exploding gradients and initialization limits
- Mapping mathematical formulations directly to PyTorch code
- Familiar with LSTM / GRU concepts and usage

### LLM Systems & Applied AI
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines
- Embeddings, indexing, and vector search
- Tool-calling and agent control flow
- SQL generation with schema validation and repair loops
- Deterministic pipelines (LLM → code → sandbox → verified output)
- Token budgeting, latency, and memory compaction strategies
